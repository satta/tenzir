# Run

Running VAST means spawning a process of the `vast` executable. A VAST process
can operate in two modes:

1. **Server**: runs continuously and listens on a network socket accepting
   connections.
2. **Client**: connects to the server to (1) submit a request and receive a
   response, (2) publish data, or (3) subscribe to data.

:::info VAST Node
A server contains a special component called the *node* that acts as container
for pluggable components implemented as
[actors](/docs/understand-vast/architecture/actor-model). In the future, VAST
will be able to connect multiple nodes together to create a distributed system.

A standard deployment consists of a server close to the data sources and
multiple clients that publish events and submit queries:

![Client & Server](/img/run.dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

## Start a server

The `start` command spins up a VAST server that blocks until told to
[stop](#stop-a-server):

```bash
vast start
```

By default, a VAST server listens on localhost and TCP port 42000.

Usually you would invoke `vast start` only for testing purposes in a terminal.
In production you would typically use a service manager, e.g., [systemd on
Linux](/docs/setup-vast/install/linux#systemd).

## Stop a server

There exist 3 ways stop a server:

1. Hit CTRL+C in the same TTY where you started VAST.
2. Send the process a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, e.g., via `pkill -2 vast`.
   Sending VAST a SIGTERM is the same as (1).
3. Run `vast stop`.

Option (3) comes in handy when you are working with a remote VAST server.

## Spawn a client

Every command except for `start` is a client command that interacts with a
server. Run `vast help` for a list of available commands.

To select a specific VAST server to connect to,
[configure](/docs/setup-vast/configure) the endpoint, e.g., by providing
`--endpoint=host:port` on the command line, exporting the environment variable
`VAST_ENDPOINT=host:port`, or setting the configuration option
`vast.endpoint: host:port` in your `vast.yaml`.
